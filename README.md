# ðŸ§¸ Toy-Language Interpreter
Using the model-view-controller architectural pattern and the object-oriented concepts implemented in Java an interpreter for a toy language capable of: 
- accepting multiple data types (i.e. integer, boolean, string, reference types)
- evaluating expressions (i.e. arithmetic, logic, relational expressions)
- executing complex statements (i.e. assignment, if-else, while, fork statements)
- logging information about each execution step inside external files
- having besides a local stack, a global heap with a garbage collector
- handling multi-threading
- type-checking [update in the near future]
